  <h2>eCS risk prediction model</h2>

  <p>
    The information in this model describes the emergency cesarean delivery (eCS) risk prediction outcome in a term pregnancy for a population of individuals in low-risk pregnant, specifically using the prenatal obstetric and non-obstetric factors.
  </p>
  
<p>
  The model was developed using data from the CHILD cohort study, the largest-hands-on longitudinal birth cohort in Canada. The score has good national generalizability as pregnant women were recruited between 2009 and 2012 from four Canadian provinces: Alberta (Edmonton, urban), British Columbia (Vancouver, urban), Manitoba (Winnipeg, urban; Modern and Winkler, rural), and Ontario (Toronto, urban).
</p>

<p>
  The eCS score included six predictors (maternal age, height, BMI, pregnancy-induced hypertension, antenatal depression, and birth order of the infant). Of note, multiple pregancy participants were excluded from the model. 
</p>

<p>
  Scores (from 0 – 14) were categorized into three grades (0 to 3; Table 1). Compared to grade 0, women with grade 2 had an odds ratio of 6.11 (3.06-12.19) for an emergency CS while women with a grade 3 had an odds ratio of 13.96 (7.32-26.61) for an emergency CS.

  PLEASE NOTE: Information from this model is not intended to be the basis for making care decisions for an individual, nor is it intended to be a definitive means of assessing the chance of eCs in those with a term pregnancy. Users should keep in mind that every patient is an individual, and that factors beyond those described on this tool influence eCs in a term pregnancy. No data are stored through this tool.

  Thank you!
